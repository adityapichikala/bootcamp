import numpy as np

'''
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. It provides high-performance vector, matrix, and higher-dimensional data structures for Python. Some of the key features of NumPy include:

Arrays: NumPy's main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers.

Mathematical Functions: NumPy provides a large set of mathematical functions that can be performed on arrays. These include arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, statistical functions, and more.

Broadcasting: NumPy's broadcasting capability allows universal functions to deal with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.

Linear Algebra: NumPy provides a rich set of functions for linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, matrix decomposition, eigenvalues, and more.

Integration with Other Libraries: NumPy seamlessly integrates with other libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem, such as SciPy (scientific computing), Matplotlib (data visualization), and pandas (data manipulation).
